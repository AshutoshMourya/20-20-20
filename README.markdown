# Blink Reminder Chrome Extension

## Overview
The Blink Reminder Chrome Extension is a simple tool designed to promote eye health by reminding users to blink every 20 minutes. Regular blinking helps prevent eye strain and dryness, especially during prolonged screen time. This extension sends a notification every 20 minutes to encourage users to take a brief moment to blink and rest their eyes. 

## Features
- **Periodic Notifications**: Displays a reminder notification every 20 minutes to prompt users to blink.
- **Lightweight and Non-Intrusive**: Runs in the background with minimal resource usage.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Includes a simple popup to start or stop the reminder.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the notification interval by updating the code (default set to 20 minutes).

## Installation
1. **Download the Extension**:
   - Clone or download this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/AshutoshMourya/20-20-20.git
     ```
2. **Load in Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable **Developer mode** (toggle in the top-right corner).

3. **Use the Extension**:
   - The extension will automatically start sending notifications every 20 minutes.

2. Update the interval in the `setInterval` function (e.g., `20 * 60 * 1000` milliseconds for 20 minutes).
3. Reload the extension in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` > click "Reload").

### Building and Testing
